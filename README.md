# Health-Care-Analysis-Dashboard
The objective of this project is to leverage Power BI for a deep dive into the provided healthcare datasets. This task encompasses meticulous data cleaning and sophisticated data modeling, utilizing DAX for advanced analytics. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard in Power BI that presents a cohesive narrative of the healthcare data. This dashboard should serve as a tool to uncover and visualize important trends, such as the interplay between patient demographics and treatment outcomes, cost implications of various medical procedures, and overall hospital performance metrics. Your analysis will provide invaluable insights, aiding healthcare providers in enhancing patient care and operational efficiency, and positioning HealthStat Solutions at the forefront of healthcare analytics.

PatientName: Name of the patient.

Age: Age of the patient.

Gender: Gender of the patient.

BloodType: Blood type of the patient.

Diagnosis: The diagnosis given to the patient.

Treatment: The treatment provided to the patient.

AdmissionDate: Date when the patient was admitted.

DischargeDate: Date when the patient was discharged.

TotalBill: The total bill amount for the patient's treatment.

Full Prescription Details: Detailed prescription information including medication names, dosages, frequency, and duration

![Health Care Dataset 2](https://github.com/Saurabh-Ratnaparkhi/Health-Care-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/HealthcareDataset2.xlsx)

PatientID: A unique identifier for each patient, corresponding to 'PatientID' in "HealthcareDataset1.xlsx". (Foreign Key)

Overall Objective:

Create a comprehensive, interactive, and visually appealing Power BI dashboard to analyze healthcare data, identify trends, and support data-driven decision making.

Specific Objectives:

Data Visualization:

Develop clear and informative visualizations for key metrics such as patient demographics, diagnoses, treatment costs, and recovery ratings.

Dashboard Design:

Construct a user-friendly dashboard with intuitive navigation and engaging visuals.

Time Series Analysis:

Incorporate time-based trends in patient admissions, length of stay, and other relevant metrics.

Comparative Analysis:

Enable comparison of hospital performance across various parameters like patient load, treatment costs, and recovery outcomes.

Treatment Effectiveness Analysis:

Visualize treatment effectiveness based on factors such as length of stay and recovery ratings.

Insight Generation:

Extract meaningful insights from the data and communicate them effectively through the dashboard.

By achieving these objectives, the dashboard will provide valuable insights into healthcare operations, support performance improvement, and inform strategic decision-making.
After working on the dashboard I believe all the above objectives have been fulfilled.
